# Discretia!

## Discretia - SFML-based interactive educational game

The purpose of the game is open all games items. <br>
For that you have to use discrete opertaion. <br>
You can do **union, complement, intersect, relative complement or even symmetric difference** of items!<br>
P.S. Only union works for now :)<br>
